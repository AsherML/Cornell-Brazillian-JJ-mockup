This is the website that my team and I created for the Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu club. I am responsible for the calendar page, the navigation header, and the Jiu-Jitsu Basics page. I also contributed heavily to the overall design of the page and helped implement responsiveness for mobile use. This website was created as part of the INFO 1300 Introduction to Web Design Course, and my partners included Ava Tan, Jonna Chen, and Leo Park.
